        'The traditional method of cooking is to place the ingredients inside a sealed clay jug. The clay jug is then placed in the coals at the bottom of a tandir, which is a large clay pot oven buried in the earth. When cooked, the still sealed clay jug is then delivered to your table, after having been left for 5 minutes when removed from the coals. The neck of the clay jug is then gently broken in front of you and the “lid” removed. Luckily the waiter performs this potentially embarrassing task!',

        'Dumplings in Turkish are called manti and it’s one of the most famous Turkish foods. Just like Turkish kebabs. A dough similar to pasta dough is rolled out, cut in tiny squares and filled with a spicy ground lamb or beef filling. Traditionally, we serve manti with a garlicky yogurt sauce and a spicy butter sauce on it. Manti is not only known in Turkey. Just like borek, it is famous in Middle East, Central Asia and Balkan cuisines. It has different names in each culture for sure. Manty, mantu and monta are just a few of them.',
